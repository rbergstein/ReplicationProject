A CSCI 5123 Recommender Systems Replication Capstone Project

This project utilized four public rating datasets (Netflix-100M, MovieLens-25M, Ciao, FilmTrust) to replicate and extend upon a previous study ([dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864708.1864721](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864708.1864721)),
focusing on the performance of different algorithms on acheiving a top-N recommendation list.

To compile the code, the MovieLens, Ciao, and Filmtrust datasets must be downloaded seperately (https://github.com/caserec/Datasets-for-Recommender-Systems), while the Netflix-100M
dataset was sampled to size down the data so our computers could run the study in reasonable time. Once the datasets are availible, you can run the "main.py" file and the results will be
output to the terminal. Additional tweaking of the sizes of the datasets may be needed to accommodate for personal computer limitations.
